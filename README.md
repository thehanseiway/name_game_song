# name_game_song
Using the name Katie as an example, the song follows this pattern:

    Katie, Katie, bo-batie,
    Banana-fana fo-fatie
    Fee-fi-mo-matie
    Katie!
    A verse can be created for any name, with X as the name and Y as the name without the first consonant sound (if it begins with a consonant), as follows:

    (X), (X), bo-b (Y)
    Banana-fana fo-f (Y)
    Fee-fi-mo--m (Y)
    (X)!
    If the name starts with a vowel or vowel sound, the "b" "f" or "m" is inserted in front of the name.

    And if the name starts with a b, f, or m, that sound simply is not repeated. For example: Billy becomes "Billy Billy bo-illy"; Fred becomes "banana fana fo-red"; Marsha becomes "fee fi mo-arsha".
